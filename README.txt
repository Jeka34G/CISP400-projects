Working Memory test is a program that tests the working, or short-term memory test. 
1. Adjustable DISPLAY_DURATION variable to set the duration of you looking at the letters.
2. Adjustable PASS_THRESHOLD variable that determines what percentage allows you to jump to higher difficulties
3. Adjustable MAX_ATTEMPTS variable that determines when your difficulty will be lowered back.

The code offers comprehensive testing, without any need to enter initial data or keep track of the enterings. 
All tests are stored on file, and after 5 same difficulty tests the mean value is computed, and also stored
in the same file.
Was created to see how ADHD medication can potentially alter short-term/working memory. For example, 
Guanfacine was suspected on studies to improve working memory, and adderall too.
